![Diabetes Diet Bot](https://github.com/SYEDFAIZAN1987/DiabetesDietBot/blob/main/Architecture.png)
## 📌 Overview
**DiabetesDietBot** is an AI-powered chatbot developed by **Syed Faizan** for **Mysore Medical College and Research Institute** as part of a research study on how chatbots can assist **doctors and medical students** in recommending **predefined diet plans** to patients with **Type 2 Diabetes**. 

The bot leverages **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, **FAISS vector search**, and **OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo** to provide **personalized diet recommendations** based on patient profiles, such as:
- **Age** (e.g., 40s, 50s)
- **Dietary Preferences** (e.g., Vegetarian, Non-Vegetarian)
- **Caloric Requirements** (e.g., Low, Moderate, High)

It uses a dataset of **structured South Indian meal plans** extracted from a **PDF database** to generate optimized diet recommendations.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ **Clone the Repository**
```
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/DiabetesDietBot.git
cd DiabetesDietBot
```

### 2️⃣ **Install Dependencies**  
Ensure you have **Python 3.8+** installed. Then run:  

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ **Set Up API Keys**  
Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your **OpenAI API key**:  

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```
## 🛠️ Technical Details  

### 1️⃣ **Text Extraction from PDFs**  
The meal plans are extracted from `MealPlans.pdf` using `PyPDF2`:  

```
from PyPDF2 import PdfReader
reader = PdfReader("MealPlans.pdf")
text = "\n".join([page.extract_text() for page in reader.pages])
```

### 2️⃣ **FAISS-Based Retrieval**  
The extracted text is **embedded** using `OpenAIEmbeddings` and stored in a **FAISS vector database**:  

```
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS

embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
vector_store = FAISS.from_texts([meal_plans_text], embedding=embeddings)
```
### 3️⃣ **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**  
When a user inputs a query, FAISS retrieves **top 3** most relevant meal plans:  

```
docs = vector_store.similarity_search(user_input, k=3)
meal_suggestions = '\n\n'.join([doc.page_content for doc in docs])
```
